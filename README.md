### Awesome Bus

http://AwesomeB.us

Awesome Bus was my final Dev Bootcamp final project, built over a hectic 6 days in May. It combines real time San Francisco transit data with Google directions. Enter a starting location and destination and the app tells you when you need to leave to catch your bus. The project was the brainchild of [Julianne Beaudoin](https://github.com/tinybeauts) and built with my team of Julianne, [Eric Dykstra](https://github.com/EricDykstra/) and [Hannah Winter](https://github.com/hannahstwinter)

After 8 weeks of focusing on Ruby, Sinatra and Rails, we built this project almost entirely in Javascript despite having had a very limited exposure to the language prior to taking this on. It was incredibly challenging and we all learned a ton and had a blast. The piece I built which I'm most proud of is the code to display a timer (https://github.com/julienisbet/AwesomeB.us/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/countdown.js) which uses an HTML5 canvas and some 9th grade trigonometry to create a countdown timer. 

Feel free to read through and comment on the code. One of these days I'll go back and refactor everything :)
